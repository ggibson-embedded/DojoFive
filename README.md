Interview Challenge

For me the Practical Challenge was a bit more difficult than it likely was for other people as I have not used any of the tools that were involved in any of the challenges. I had never used Github until now but I am impressed with all of these tools so far.

I chose Option 3: Simultate All The Things. I found the documentation for renode pretty thorough and relatively easy to follow. After installing the first major snag I hit was when I set up an environment for STM32 or nRF52 devices I received errors that it failed to download due to SecureChannelFailure. I was unable to find much information about what the cause of this issue could be.

Running Renode program:
Open renode
type "s @scripts/single-node/stm32f4_discovery.resc" to start STM32f4.
